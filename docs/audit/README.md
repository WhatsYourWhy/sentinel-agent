## Audit docs (current vs archived)

This folder is intentionally kept small and “current”.

- **Start here**: `Contract_Index.md` (maps README/documented contracts to enforcing code/tests).
- **Archived audit materials** (repro logs, point-in-time reports, diffs): `../archive/audit/2026-01/`

If you create a new audit run, prefer adding a short entry to `Contract_Index.md` and placing the full log bundle under `docs/archive/audit/<yyyy-mm>/`.
