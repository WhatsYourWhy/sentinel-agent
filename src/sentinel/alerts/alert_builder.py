    Build a minimal alert for a single event.
    
    Classification is determined by network impact score, not just input severity_guess.
    This makes classification deterministic and testable.
    
    Note: The alert model includes deprecated fields for backward compatibility:
    - `priority` mirrors `classification` (will be removed in v0.4)
    - `diagnostics` mirrors `evidence.diagnostics` (will be removed in v0.4)
    
    New code should use `classification` and `evidence.diagnostics`.
